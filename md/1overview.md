### About

This software tool implements the SMR & HEIDI methods to test for
pleiotropic association between the expression level of a gene and a
complex trait of interest using summary-level data from GWAS and
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies [(Zhu et al. 2016 Nat Genet)](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3538.html).
The methodology can be interpreted as an analysis to test if the effect
size of a SNP on the phenotype is mediated by gene expression. This tool
can therefore be used to prioritize genes underlying GWAS hits for follow-up functional studies.
